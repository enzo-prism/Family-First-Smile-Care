Build a professional, modern website for Family First Smile Care, a family-oriented dental practice in Los Gatos, CA. The site should be welcoming, stress-free, and family-friendly, emphasizing gentle, compassionate care for all ages, especially children and anxious patients. Use a clean, warm color scheme (e.g., soft blues, greens, and whites) to evoke trust and comfort, with high-quality images of smiling families, kids, and dental tools (source royalty-free images if needed). Ensure the site is fully responsive for mobile and desktop, SEO-optimized with meta tags, alt text for images, and fast-loading. Build it using HTML5, CSS3 (with Flexbox/Grid for layout), and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no heavy frameworks unless necessary; Bootstrap is optional for quick responsiveness). Host it on Replit with a simple static setup—no backend required, but include a contact form that submits via email (use Formspree or similar free service if needed, or simulate with JS).
