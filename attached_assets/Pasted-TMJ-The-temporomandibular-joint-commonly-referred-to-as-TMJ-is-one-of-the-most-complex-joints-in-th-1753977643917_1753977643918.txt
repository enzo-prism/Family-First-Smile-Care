TMJ
The temporomandibular joint, commonly referred to as TMJ is one of the most complex joints in the human body. Located on both sides of your jaw, it connects your jawbone to your skull and allows for essential functions like chewing, speaking, and even smiling. However, when this joint becomes inflamed or dysfunctional, it can lead to a condition known as temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). Common symptoms include jaw pain, stiffness, headaches, difficulty chewing, and even clicking or popping sounds when moving your jaw. At Family First Smile Care, we specialize in diagnosing and treating TMJ in Los Gatos, aiming to restore your comfort and quality of life.
How Treatment for TMJ in Los Gatos Can Help  
Living with the discomfort and pain caused by TMJ issues can be overwhelming, but effective treatment options are available. At Family First Smile Care, we take a personalized approach to address your specific symptoms and needs. Depending on the severity of your condition, TMJ treatment in Los Gatos ranges from non-invasive therapies to advanced dental procedures.  

Some of the most common treatments for TMJ include:

Custom Night Guards: We design night guards to prevent teeth grinding and clenching, which can exacerbate TMJ discomfort.  
Orthodontic Solutions: Conditions related to bite misalignment can be treated through customized orthodontic treatment plans, such as braces or Invisalign.  
Physical Therapy: Jaw exercises and muscle relaxation techniques can alleviate tension and improve function.  
Lifestyle Modifications: Stress reduction, dietary changes, and exercise can often significantly improve the management of TMJ symptoms.  
Advanced Procedures: For more severe cases, we may recommend targeted treatments, such as restorative dental work, to improve the alignment of your bite.  
Our goal is to address the root cause of your TMJ issues to alleviate pain, restore proper jaw function, and improve overall well-being.
